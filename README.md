My project is a nuker bot. I've provided the source code below, but I am not responsible for how you use it. If you encounter any issues, feel free to add me on Discord: "yacnox".  

This bot offers several commands, including **/cmds** to make things easier for you. Here’s what it can do:  

- **hlp** : show you all cmds
- **nuke:** Deletes all channels, creates new ones, spams messages with @everyone, changes the server name, and bans everyone.  
- **del:** Deletes specific channels you choose.  
- **crt:** Creates one or more new channels.  
- **wipe:** Deletes all channels, with the option to add exceptions.  
- **banall:** Bans all members, with the possibility to add exceptions.
- **purger**: Clears messages from channels

This bot is written in **Python**, so make sure to install the language and also refer to the list of necessary modules to install; otherwise, the program might not run correctly.  

Please note that I might update or improve the code in the future. The current version is about 600 lines long, and I should probably split it into multiple files to keep it organized.  

Enjoy using the bot! ;)


Here are a few examples of what the bot can do in action. I’ll also be adding GIFs in the future!

You can see a demonstration of the bot on my YouTube channel. I want to emphasize that the version on YouTube has been improved; I multiplied the code by 15.
